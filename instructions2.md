## Python: Basic Data Types & Operations 2

## Finished?

- Grade your script using the checklist your teacher provides
- Meet with your teacher
- Show him your code
- Revise your code if necessary
- **No need to share your work with your teacher on this project**

## Comment Block

- Add a comment block to the top of your script
```python
# Abraham Lincoln
# 24 MAR 20XX
# Basic Data Types & Operations
```

## Your Code

- Write the code for each task below in your `main.py` file
- Use comments to label each task
  
## Task 1

- Write a script that adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides two floats
- Assign a number between 1 and 20 to each variable
- Identify and print the result of each calculation on a separate line

  ---

## Task 2

- Create a CONSTANT named PI and assign it the value 3.14159
- Define a variable `radius` that stores the length of a circle's radius (in feet)
- Use the CONSTANT and the radius length to calculate and display the area of the circle (in square feet)
- Include the units in your output

## Task 3

- Look up the height of the Empire State Building (including its spire and the antenna) online
- Write a script that uses a CONSTANT to convert the building's height in feet to meters
- Use **concatenation** to display on separate lines the building's height in feet and in meters
- Include the units in your output
